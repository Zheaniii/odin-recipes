        <h2> Description </h2>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup butter</li>
            <li>2 Leeks, sliced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon, cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 Quart, chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 Pinch, Cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 Cups, Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 Cups heavy cream, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in soup pot over medium-high heat. Add leeks and salt; cook until leeks begin to wilt. Reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook until soft and almost pastelike, 30 to 40 minutes. </li>
            <li>Place potatoes in the pot; add chicken broth. Adjust heat so mixture simmers slowly. Cook until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Puree mixture with an immersion blender or in batches in a blender. Whisk in heavy cream. Heat over medium heat. Add more salt, if needed, and cayenne pepper. Do not boil. </li>
            <li>Serve with a drizzle of heavy cream and a sprinkle of chopped chives. </li>
        </ol>
